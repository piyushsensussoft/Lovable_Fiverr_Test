### 1. Duplicate Confirmation Email Issue

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity:** High
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Issue Summary**

- Confirmation email was being sent **twice** per form submission.
- Users were receiving **duplicate emails**, leading to confusion.

**Underlying Cause**

- There were **two identical `supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation')`** blocks in the `handleSubmit` function.

**Solution Applied**

```ts
// Removed the second redundant email sending block
const { error: emailError } = await supabase.functions.invoke(
  "send-confirmation",
  {
    body: {
      name: formData.name,
      email: formData.email,
      industry: formData.industry,
    },
  }
);
```

**Outcome**
✅ Confirmation email is now delivered **just once per submission**
✅ Enhanced clarity and professionalism for users
✅ Minimized redundant email triggers, reducing backend load and costs

### 2. Lead Storage Not Working

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity:** Critical
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Issue Summary**

- Lead information was **not getting recorded** in the database
- Submissions appeared successful, but no data was actually stored


**Underlying Cause**

- Missing Supabase logic
- No check for existing emails or error handling

**Solution Applied**

```ts
// Check if email already exists
const { data: existingLead, error: checkError } = await supabase
  .from("leads")
  .select("email")
  .eq("email", formData.email)
  .single();

// If not exists, insert new lead
const { error: insertError } = await supabase.from("leads").insert({
  name: formData.name,
  email: formData.email,
  industry: formData.industry,
});
```

**Outcome**
✅ Leads are now correctly stored in the database
✅ Implemented check to prevent duplicate email entries
✅ Added error handling for both lookup and insertion processes


---

### 3. Toast Notifications for User Feedback

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** ✅ Added

**Enhancement**

- Show clear and intuitive notifications to inform users of success or failure

**Notification Cases**

```ts
// Success
toast({ title: "Success!", description: "Lead submitted successfully!" });

// Already exists
toast({
  title: "Lead Already Exists",
  description: "This lead already exists.",
  variant: "destructive",
});

// DB insert error
toast({
  title: "Error",
  description: "Failed to save your information. Please try again.",
  variant: "destructive",
});

// Unexpected error
toast({
  title: "Error",
  description: "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.",
  variant: "destructive",
});
```

**Outcome**
✅ Clear and relevant feedback provided to users
✅ Enhanced user experience with reduced uncertainty after submission

---

### 4. Submission Loading State with Spinner

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity:** Low (UX)
**Status:** ✅ Added

**Issue Summary**

- Users could **submit the form multiple times** quickly
- No visual indicator that submission is in progress

**Solution Applied**

```tsx
// Track submit state
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);

// In button
disabled = { isSubmitting };
{
  isSubmitting ? (
    <>
      <Loader2 className="w-5 h-5 mr-2 animate-spin" />
      Submitting...
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      <CheckCircle className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" />
      Get Early Access
    </>
  );
}
```

**Outcome**
✅ Blocks repeated form submissions during processing
✅ Displays a loading spinner and disables the submit button
✅ Delivers a polished and responsive user interface experience
